## **psychoGE:** joint impact of environmental and genetic determinants on the aetiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders

The main objectives of the study are to explore the genetic variants that moderate stress-induced environmental patterns in an immune cell-type-specific manner; and  assess how these epigenetic, i.e. environmental, and genetic biomarkers relate to the risk for psychiatric disorders

# Data

Participants comprised **289** Caucasian individuals of the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP) in Munoch. Of the participants, 

    + 93 women and 196 men
    + 129 (81 men, 48 women) were treated for major dipressive disorders (MDD)
    + 160 (115 men, 45 women) were healthy controls with no history of a depressive disorder. 

Baseline whole blood samples were obtained at 6 pm after two hours of fasting and abstention from coffee and physical activity. Subjects then received 1.5 mg oral dexamethasone, and a second blood draw was performed at 9 pm, three hours after dexamethasone ingestion.

The available multiomics data for the currect project:

    - Methylation
    - Gene-expression
    - Genotype
    - Phenotype
